# üìÑ Schema Documentation: Device (`device.json`)

This schema describes the structure for device objects in Weed Breed.
Each device has a UUID as its `id` and is loaded via a central factory.

## üÜî Base Fields

| Field        | Type    | Description                               |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | string  | UUID of the device                        |
| `kind`       | string  | Device type (e.g., `ClimateUnit`, `Lamp`) |
| `name`       | string  | Display name for UI usage                 |
| `quality`    | number  | Quality factor (0‚Äì1)                      |
| `complexity` | number  | Complexity value for setup/maintenance    |
| `mtbf_hours` | number  | *Mean Time Between Failures* (in hours)   |

## ‚öô Device Settings

```json
"settings": {
  "power": 1.2,
  "coolingCapacity": 1.6,
  "airflow": 350,
  "targetTemperature": 24,
  "targetTemperatureRange": [18, 30],
  "coolingEfficiency": 0.05,
  "maxCooling": 0.4,
  "hysteresisK": 0.5,
  "fullPowerAtDeltaK": 5
}
```

- The fields in `settings` are **device-dependent**
- Units follow the conventions from [`naming_conventions.md`](./naming_conventions.md)

## üßæ Description Level (`meta`)

```json
"meta": {
  "description": "‚Ä¶",
  "advantages": [ "‚Ä¶" ],
  "disadvantages": [ "‚Ä¶" ],
  "notes": "‚Ä¶"
}
```

| Field           | Type     | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `description`   | string   | Purpose and use of the device                |
| `advantages`    | string[] | Operational advantages                       |
| `disadvantages` | string[] | Disadvantages or limitations                 |
| `notes`         | string   | Technical or strategic notes (opt.)        |

## ‚ùå Not Included

The following fields are **not** stored in the device but are externalized to `devicePrices.json`:

| Field                      | Reason                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `capitalExpenditure`       | Market value, not a device parameter  |
| `baseMaintenanceCostPerTick`| Economic factor                       |
| `costIncreasePer1000Ticks` | Maintenance model ‚Üí external control  |

‚Üí This separation allows for pricing logic, offers, and balancing **without changing the device definition**.
